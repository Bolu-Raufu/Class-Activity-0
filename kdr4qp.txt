I am a first-year CPE graduate student. During my undergraduate studies, I took courses in Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, and Real-Time Operating Systems. Currently, I am taking Computer Architecture and Design.

Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, Python, VHDL, Verilog, Assembly
Microcontrollers and Embedded Platforms: Arduino, AVR

My personal interests lie in Embedded Systems, Operating Systems, and Computer Vision. I have worked on some projects involving autonomous robots and F1Tenth before. Through this class, I hope to deepen my understanding of Embedded Systems and IoT, which I believe will be beneficial for my future studies.
