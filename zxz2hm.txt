I am currently a third-year B.S. Computer Engineering student. I previously took CS 2130: Computer Systems and Organization 1, in Fall 2022, covering basic computer architecture; ECE 3430: Introduction to Embedded Computer Systems in Spring 2023, covering embedded systems programming on a TI MSP432 microcontroller; and CS 3130: Computer Systems and Organization 2, in Fall 2023, covering more sophisticated computer architecture and some operating systems material related to POSIX standard environments. In these and other classes, I have used C, Python, Bash, Java, and a bit of x86-64 assembly. My favorite language by far, however, is C, due to its capabilities in low-level applications.

I am interested in computer architecture, embedded systems, operating systems, and cybersecurity. Advanced Embedded Computing Systems offers an exciting chance to bring together my interests in one course, particularly with embedded systems and operating systems. I cannot wait to start writing a real-time operating system (RTOS) for the Tiva microcontroller. I hope to improve my ability to handle operating system features like threads and synchronization primitives in C, and to understand new operating system features like schedulers and semaphores. The thought of actually writing a kernel to be implemented in hardware could not be more energizing, and I look forward to diving in.
