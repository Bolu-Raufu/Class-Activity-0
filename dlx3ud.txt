I am a fourth-year computer and electrical engineering major here at UVA, 
where I've been exposed to a decent amount of embedded systems and their components. 
I have taken the following related courses: 
- Intro to Embedded Systems, 
- Operating Systems, 
- Computer Architecture, 
- Embedded System Design (Capstone), 
- AI Hardware, 
- and Control Systems. 
I have created the following relevant projects:
- Mountain Directed Energy Wayfinder Capstone Project 
    - (automated assistive astronomy tool using STM32G071RB and LCD header board)
I have also worked with the MSP430 and the TI Code Composer platform for Intro to Embedded,
and the NVidia Jetson Nano board for my final group demonstration in AI Hardware. 
The programming languages I am most familiar with are C/C++, Python, and MATLAB. 

I am interested in studying embedded systems both from an engineering and a policy perspective. 
While a lot of my undergraduate engineering education was focused on designing circuits and systems
to approach embedded systems as optimization problems addressing constraints in power, latency, memory,
this past summer I worked for the Science and Technology team at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 
where I evaluated the performance, benefits, and challenges of virtual reality (VR) and augmented
reality (AR) systems at a high-level. Gaining a more formal understanding of embedded system design as 
a whole will give me a platform to equally apply both my engineering technical background and these 
other skills in policy analysis and work and seeing how they can combine into something that can 
benefit lots of people. At the same time, I would like to also learn to properly evaluate existing
embedded systems to make sure they meet quantitative measures of performance, and see how that knowledge
can be applied in this burgeoning field as leaders in industry/government/academia are figuring out
what standards and guardrails should be in place for these systems to ensure certain levels of performance.
