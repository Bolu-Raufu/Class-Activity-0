I took Intro to Embedded Systems last semester and am currently in Computer Architecture & Design. The former useed an STM32 
microcontroller and the STM Cube IDE. My first-year, Intro to Engineering course involved a lot of time with Arduino and its 
IDE. All of my embedded programming has been in C.

I really enjoyed Intro to Embedded Systems last semester and wanted to continue learning more about the field. I'm especially
interested to create more sophisticated and interactive embedded systems.
