CPE Major, took intro embedded last semester using 
an STM32 microcontroller. Currently in CSO2. 
I am also an MSE Major, I like working out and 
playing videogames sometimes. After this class I hope 
to have the capability to independently be able to program 
embedded devices to accomplish various goals.
