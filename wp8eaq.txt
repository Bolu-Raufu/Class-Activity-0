I don't have any embedded systems design background but I have taken OS and Computer Architecture courses before. In OS we built our own OS that does task switching, job scheduling, interrupt handeling and virtual memory address translation.
I'm interested in AI/ML and computer game design. In OS class, we had the chance to use a Raspberry Pi to host the OS instead of a simulated platform, but the number of equipments were limited so I didn't get to try it. In this class, I hope I can get more experience using such systems.
