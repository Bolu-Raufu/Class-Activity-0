I'm a Masters Computer Science student who is very interested in robotics and autonomous vehicles. I do not have a lot of background with regard to embedded systems. My only background is my undergraduate Computer Architecture course. My internship this past summer (which I will be returning to full-time post graduation) required me to do a lot of low-level embedded programming. I'm taking this course to learn more about embedded programming so I will be better prepared for my job next year. I also want to learn more about embedded applications for larger scale projects like autonomous drones and spacecraft.
I have experience with Python, C++, and working on robotics projects that use ROS (Robot Operating Software) as the main framework.
