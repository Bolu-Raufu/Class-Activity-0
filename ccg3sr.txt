John Berberian, Jr. (ccg3sr)

Background:
 - Working with Swami's group on developing an embedded system for real-time microfluidic deformability measurements.

Courses:
 - Intro to Embedded
 - CSO 1

Projects:
 - Microfluidic impedance cytometry: real-time trigger mechanism

Platforms and Processors:
 - MSP432, Cortex-M4F
 - STM32H745ZI, Cortex-M7 and Cortex-M4F

Languages:
 - C / C++
 - Python
 - Rust
 - Java

I have an interest in CPS and real-time systems, and I'd like to try using an RTOS with scheduling to do complex tasks in a resource-constrained environment. I also have a research project that would directly benefit from learning how to structure embedded firmware to optimize for tight timing constraints.
